  =>>>  The working flow of this project.At first the frontend parts are divided into reusuable components.As we moving through this project you will find the use of some things like.

1)Resuable components and hooks(useState,useEffect)

2)The major components are placed in the components folder with meaningful names of each component folder.Then Each  folder contains the jsx files.

3)The nav folder contains nav file which is exported into App.jsx file.

4)Then the menu_swiper directory comes into play which contains Menu_swiper.jsx file, contains swiperjs library in react.Then ,Props passes through Menu_swiper.jsx to Menu_body.jsx.According to the value Passes from Menu_swiper.jsx the component in Menu_body also passes the props to the affected component.

5)Practical approach Example:When we click the veg item the 0 value is passed to Menu_body.jsx file.Here is the condition if it is "0" it passes other props like name,price,image_link to the Special_eachitem.jsx file.It is similar to other items lists also.
